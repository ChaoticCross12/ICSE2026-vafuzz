Here we have listed the overall runtime.

**Important notes:**
1. The numbers represent **minutes** spent throughout 24 hours.
2. Each cell is the average across 5 trials spanning 24 hours.
3. We rounded the data to the 2th decimal.

**Key Observation:** The runtime overhead thus far, has been relatively low.
